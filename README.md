# Python1000-Practice-Activities
This free & open project contains additional activities for intermediate Python students, or students who have completed our "Python 1000" Training SERIES. 

If you've no experience with programming, here is our primer - it is "mostly free:" https://www.udemy.com/python-1000

If you have no experience with Python 3 but know how to program, then: https://www.udemy.com/python-1100

Designed for software developers who are interested in creating software from professionally defined use cases using the most common set of UML diagrams, students enrolled in other Python training opportunities will also enjoy these activities.

PRINTED BOOK
--------
Recently combined together with the ***official source code*** as well as ***3 bonus exercies*** & no-nonsence career advice, we wanted everyone to know that our new book "Python 1000, By Requirement" (or simply "Python by Requirement") is now available on Amazon. In addition to the official code and additional exercises, **Python by Requirement** also shares a few of the project insights that I use to help me succeed in our modern, profe$$ional software developer world.

New software developers should note that the book ***includes a coupon***. The coupon allows anyone to view our Python 1000, 2000, and 3000 Videos for free. This FREE SET of OVER 13 HOURS OF PROFESSIONL TRAINIG ON PYTHON 3, includes.
